# Snake-Game
Snake game consists of a snake and a map which shows the location of apples. The goal is to eat all apples in minimum steps. 
In this project, the game is solved by using different search strategies: Uninformed search and informed search. Uninformed implemented search algorithms are BFS and IDS. A* and weighted A* are two informed search strategies which are implemented.
